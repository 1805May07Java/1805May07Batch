I have a Computer Science: Game Design degree from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
I have extensive experience with C# and .NET as used with Unity.  In college I also made a 
Web API-connected web app in Web2Py that helps you find good teammates in League of Legends.

I am hoping to get more exposure to web application development, with an emphasis on marketable
skills and technologies that are used in enterprise development.
