#Alexander Moon's code

Hello,

I have a BA from Rutgers University.
major in Information Technology, minor in Comp sci

I previously worked as a frontend developer making websites from scratch using html, css, and javascript.

There are two simple things I want out of this program:
1. Learn new frameworks and libraries
2. Get a job
