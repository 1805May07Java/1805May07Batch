#Banking Assignment: Iteration II
## Due during Tuesday's QC (3/12/18)
```
Create a mock bank in which you communicate with your user
via the console. Persist your data an in Oracle SQL database
using JDBC. You must use at least one of each a Statement,
PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement. Use the DAO design
pattern. Use proper coding conventions. Test your code.

As a user, I can:
* create an account with a unique email and/or username
* log in
* log out
* create one or multiple accounts
* deposit money
* withdraw money
* have a joint account with another user
* have at least these three account types - 'Credit', 'Savings', 'Checking'
* view account balance

Good luck!
